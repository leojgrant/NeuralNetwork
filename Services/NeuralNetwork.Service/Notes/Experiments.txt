Experiments with the NeuralNetwork.Service:

1. When the neural network overshoots the target, with the next update, reduce the number of synapse collections that are updated.
	E.g. For a neural network of layer structure [1,2,3,1]:
	i) First overshoot - only update 2-3, and 3-1
	ii) Second overshoot - only update 3-1
	- Measure / Plot:
		1. Precision (e.g. if aiming for output of 4 with input of 1, aim for 4.00000001 instead of 4.003322 in given number of training cycles)

2. When the neural network overshoots the target, with the next update, reduce the learning rate.
	E.g. For a neural network with global learning rate of 0.001:
	i) First overshoot - change learning rate to 0.0001
	ii) Second overshoot - change learning rate to 0.00001
	- Measure / Plot:
		1. Precision (e.g. if aiming for output of 4 with input of 1, aim for 4.00000001 instead of 4.003322 in given number of training cycles)

3. Combine experiment 1 with experiment 2.
