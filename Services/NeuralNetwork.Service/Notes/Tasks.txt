Tasks with the NeuralNetwork.Service:

1-DONE. The biases of neurons are not considered in forward or back propagation at the moment - they should be.

2-DONE (replaced by Task 3 below). Randomise the initial weight value of synapses.

3-DONE. Implement an IWeightInitialiser interface and WeightInitialiser classes to use various weight initialisation methods.

4-optional. Repeat task 3 but with the bias of the neuron.

5-optional. Repeat task 3 but with the layers of the neural network (to test different strategies/types of layers e.g. combinations of activation functions in the same layer).

6. Add a monitoring class to to be used to test aspects of the neural network at various points through training 
	(e.g. are all the weights different? What is range of weight values? What is the time taken to update each layer during training etc.).
	Use this class for investigation and sanity checks - will be very useful!

7. Check that weights don't become undefined / NaN when they get tiny and then get operated on.
