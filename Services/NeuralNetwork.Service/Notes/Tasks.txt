Tasks with the NeuralNetwork.Service:

1. The biases of neurons are not considered in forward or back propagation at the moment - they should be.

2-DONE (replaced by Task 3 below). Randomise the initial weight value of synapses.

3-DONE. Implement an IWeightInitialiser interface and WeightInitialiser classes to use various weight initialisation methods.

4-optional. Repeat task 3 but with the bias of the neuron.

5-optional. Repeat task 3 but with the layers of the neural network (to test different strategies/types of layers e.g. combinations of activation functions in the same layer).
