# NeuralNetwork
A neural network class library in .NET 8, along with a simple console app to manually test it's ability to learn through forward and backpropagation.

## NeuralNetwork.Service

The neural network service offers a modular and extendable library for constructing a custom neural network with a high degree of control.

## NeuralNetwork.ConsoleApp

The neural network console app is designed with ecperimentation in mind by allowing for rapid construction of experiments

## Theory

The theory underlying the neural network service is described below.
